- Warning exiting picross if file not saved
    (as in, if there was a previous file, then check if the puzzle corresponds with the original one,
    if not, give a messagebox warning).
- Auto filler (not blanker), and then use it to check if a puzzle is logically solveable (rather than backtracking / unique).
- Auto blanker for rows that are invalid in the first place shouldn't show anything.
- Refactor row/column code duplicates.

- A proper version system
